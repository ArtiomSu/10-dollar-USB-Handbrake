# $10 USB Handbrake

This is the cheapest DIY 3D printed handbrake for pc games using an Arduino Pro micro

Thanks to Jonj57 for providing the 3d print files over on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5213117).

Thanks to AM-STUDIO for providing the Joystick library on [github](https://github.com/AM-STUDIO/Analog-E-Brake/tree/master/Joystick)

My addition to the project is providing a handy arduino sketch for configuring the deadzone and being able to flip the output of the hand brake, as well as a more noob friendly guide on how to do the whole thing.
